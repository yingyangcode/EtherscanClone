# Authenticiti Frontend Hire - Take Home Project

This "take home" project is to assess your technical abilities and give you an idea on the type of tasks you would perform at Authenticiti. The task should not take more than a day to complete. 

#### Task to complete:
 - Recreate this page https://etherscan.io

##### Specifications:
 - The page does NOT need to be interactive (i.e. button doesnt need callbacks)
 - Footer and header is NOT required
 - Top-left section can be hardcoded with static content (content in blue div)
 - Top-right section can be removed and does NOT need to be implemented (the graph) 
 - "Blocks" section on the left must use `blocks.json` to populate the table
 - "Transactions" section on the right must use `transactions.json` to populate the table
 
##### Requirements:
 - Use a modern javascript based development framework (eg. react, angular, backbone, ember) - You can use starter packs as your base (eg. https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit). 
 - Delivery Method: 
    1) Upload to a public github or other repositories with a sufficient README to run the application
    2) Deploy to a public cloud (eg. AWS) and provide the IP to access the application

##### Clarifications:
 - The CSS/appearance does not need to match exactly to the page, just the layout. 
 - You can use all types of libraries/frameworks (such as Bootstrap) - highly encouraged
